    "Stock Price Forecast": "By the end of 2024, the average price target for Coca-Cola stock is projected to reach $72.95, with an optimistic price target of $77.50.

However, concerns about overvaluation and the effectiveness of its acquisition strategy warrant caution. The company's robust profitability, strong cash flow, and consistent dividend payments make it an attractive investment for income-focused investors. Looking ahead, Coca-Cola's ability to navigate market challenges and leverage its pricing power will be crucial in sustaining its growth trajectory.",
